For about 10 years I swam competitively on Kearns Youth Aquatic Team (KYAT) and Two years in High School. I like to help students refine their stokes. I can be frustrating for a student who is struggling for an extend period of time. By breaking the stokes down into steps and build it back up. By working with drills and a single part of the stoke it helps the student to but all the parts of the stoke back together and swim the stoke better. I also like to help student learn the basics such as floating (relaxing)  blowing bubbles  etc. Once a student has mastered these skills it will make learning freestyle and the other stokes much easier. I am really good with children of all ages and am very patient. When I need to I push the students to do their best so they can succeed     Brianna,Claflin,briannac.kopfc.psl@gmail.com,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I have been working at the Kearns Oquirrh Park Fitness Center for 3 years.

I have taught babies  toddlers  children  teens  and adults and loved all of them. I have helped patrons prepare to join swim teams  gain speed for meets  or get ready for triathlons but I am partial to  and specialize in  teaching proper swimming technique and general comfort in the water. Swimming is a sport that should be enjoyable and relaxing. I was one of the principal instructors for the adult class for 10 years and LOVED working with adults because of their desire and motivation to learn how to swim. Almost everyone Ive taught has expressed their interest in always learning how to swim but have never been taught the ""correct"" way to move through the water and have a hard time getting across the pool. I go back to the basics and teach students practical and effective ways to swim that become natural and easy for them to do on their own. I love seeing the confidence and sense of accomplishment when my students get something down because swimming is a life skill and they will have that for the rest of their lives. My hope is that everyone who comes to the facility to learn how to swim  does just that and has an awesome experience while they are here."Sarah ,Shelley,novalidemail@gmail.com,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I have been teaching for almost two years.
