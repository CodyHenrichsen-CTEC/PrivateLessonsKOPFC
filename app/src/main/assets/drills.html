Kicking/Body Undulation Drills
Drills with Swim Fins

<ul>
<li>
  <h3>Butterfly Drill #1</h3> At the water surface, lie on your stomach, face down, extend your arms in front of you, and hold a kickboard. Execute the hip up and down motion as described above, and let the legs follow along and kick with your feet and fins.  Do some body undulations and kicks, and then stop to breathe, and start again.
</li>

<li>
  <h3>Butterfly Drill #3</h3>Head-lead body dolphin drill: At the water surface, lie on your stomach, face down, keep the arms at your sides, and then execute the body undulation and kicking motion.  Stop regularly to breathe.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Butterfly Drill #4</h3>Underwater, lie on your stomach, face down, extend the arms in front of you, then execute the body undulation and kicking motion. Stop regularly to breathe.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Butterfly Drill #5</h3>At the water surface, lie on your stomach, face down, extend the arms in front of you, then execute the body undulation and kicking motion. Stop regularly to breathe.
</li>
</ul>

Drills without Swim Fins
<ul>
<li>
Drills #6-9: Redo the drills #2-5 without fins.  This most likely will be rather difficult, as you relied much on the fins for propulsion.  It should help a little bit that you start again with an underwater drill, as you then have the resistance of the water both on your back and on your chest to push against.  Take your time to master the drills without fins.  Instead of directly going from with fins to without fins, you can also try to use shorter ones for a while or trim your regular ones progressively.
</li>
<li>
Drill #10: At the water surface, lie on your stomach, face down, keep the arms at your sides, and then execute the body undulation and kicking motion.  Each 3-5 cycles, press your chest and hips harder so that your head lifts above the water.  Inhale quickly, then bring your head and chest back down and continue the body undulations.
</li>
<li>
Drill #11: At the water surface, lie on your stomach, face down, extend the arms in front of you, then execute the body undulation and kicking motion.  Each 3-5 cycles, press your chest and hips harder so that your head lifts above the water.  Inhale quickly, then bring your head and chest back down and continue the body undulations.

<h1><a name="breast">Breaststroke Drills</a></h1>
Breaststroke Kick (Dryland)
Standing Individual Leg Kick (You learn to execute the different phases of the breaststroke kick, one leg at a time)
Recovery: Bend your right knee, so that you bring your heel towards your buttocks.  At the same time, flex your foot towards your shin (dorsiflexion).
Catch: When your foot is close to the buttocks, raise your right leg sideways while keeping your knee bent and your foot in dorsiflexion.
Out sweep:  When you have raised your leg about 45 degrees, extend your leg and point your foot/toes (Plantar flexion). But keep your leg lifted sideways.
In sweep: Bring your right leg back into the initial position at the end of the leg extension.
In the beginning, observe a slight pause between each phase.  Afterwards execute all the kick phases’ in one fluid movement.  Repeat this a few times with your right leg, and then switch to your left leg.
Breaststroke Kick on a Chair
In this dryland exercise, you simultaneously rehearse the kick movements with both legs.  You need a chair for this exercise:
Sit close towards the chair’s front edge
Grab the seat of the chair on the side with both hands
Extend your legs forward, lifting them about 5 inches above the ground.
Point your feet.
Now practice the different phases of the kick like you did in the previous exercise.  But your legs should now move simultaneously:
Bend your knees and bring your feet towards the buttocks in dorsiflexion
Spread your legs apart while keeping your knees bent and your feet in dorsiflexion
Extend your legs and simultaneously point your feet
Finally bring your extended legs back together into their initial position
Repeat this exercise a few times, at first slowly and then in one continuous movement
Breaststroke Kick on the Floor
Now you will practice the leg movements in a position close to the one you are in while swimming breaststroke, in a prone position.
Starting position is as follows:
Lie down on the floor on  your stomach
Place your arms in front of you in a comfortable position
Extend your legs with feet pointed
Now practice the breaststroke kick.  It will most likely take a little bit of concentration as you are now turned downwards whereas in the previous exercise you were turned upwards.
Rehearsing the movements while lying on your stomach is also interesting because you can’t flex at your hips while bringing your feet towards the buttocks.  Instead you learn to correctly fold your lower legs onto your upper legs to bring your feet towards the buttocks.  Using this technique in the water allows the swimmer to decrease drag.
Conclusion After having practiced the breaststroke kick on dry land you can start to practice it in the water.  This swimming technique is also used in elementary backstroke and while treading water.
Breaststroke Kick (In Water)
The following breaststroke drills will teach you how to do breaststroke kick in the water AFTER having practiced it on dry land.  You will use noodles and a kickboard to help with floatation in the water.  You will also begin to synchronize breathing with the movements of your legs.
Breaststroke Kick Holding onto the Pool Edge
Lie across the edge of the pool, with your upper body resting on the wall and your legs dangling in the water.
Extend your legs backwards and bring them together to get into the initial position.
Execute the breaststroke kick’s phases (Recovery, Catch, Out sweep, In sweep): feet recover towards the buttocks, feet turn outwards and catch the water, legs extend backwards and outwards then backwards and inwards, legs are completely extended and together and then the cycle starts anew.
Repeat a few times until you get fluid and consistent movements with your legs in the water.
Notice how the pressure of the water against your legs pushes you towards the wall.
 Breaststroke Kick with Noodle
In this drill you will actually move forward using the breaststroke kick for propulsion.  Use a noodle to provide buoyancy to your upper body so that you don’t need to use your arms and can concentrate on your legs’ movements.  
Place noodle across your chest and under your armpits (make sure the noodle provides enough buoyancy to keep you floating with your shoulders and head above water).
Get into a prone position with your arms extended forward.
Push off and start to kick like you did in the previous exercise
Use the kick for propulsion
Keep your head above water


Breaststroke Kick with a Kickboard, No Breathing
In this drill you will use a kickboard instead of water noodles for additional buoyancy.  This will allow you to assume a more horizontal and slippery position in the water.
Hold kickboard in front of you (hands on board only-no arms)
Push off and try to assume a horizontal position, with your face in the water and your head in line with your spine
Continue with breaststroke kick, head in the water, to move forward.
After a few kicks lift your head to take a breath
*If you have trouble keeping your legs up and your body horizontal, try to apply some downward pressure with your head and chest to counterbalance dropping hips and legs.  Your head should stay in line with your trunk.
Breaststroke Kick with a Kickboard/Breathing
This exercise is similar to the previous one, but you will now integrate breathing into the drill cycle.  
Push of while holding the kickboard in front of you
Kick a few times
Raise your head above water at the end of the last kick, just before you recover your feet towards the buttocks.  Inhale as soon as your mouth clears the water.
Let your chest and head drop back into the water after breathing and immediately start to exhale.  Your legs continue the recovery phase.
Kick a few times again; raise your head to inhale, etc.
Exhale continuously while your headis in the water.
After a while, try to progressively reduce the number of kicks between each breath, until you inhale after each kick cycle.

<a name="back">Elementary Backstroke</a>
Practice the three different floats with your students both outside and in the water to help them understand the concepts of the whole stroke. 
<ul>
<li>
Monkey Float (arms and legs bent)
</li><li>
Airplane or Starfish Float (arms wide like an airplane, legs spread apart)
</li><li>
Soldier Float (arms squeezed together on the side of the body, legs squeezed together and extended) 
</li>
</ul>
Students should inhale during the first phase of the stroke, while drawing their arms and legs into the “monkey float” position.  Students should then exhale slowly and continuously as they perform the second and third phase of the stroke (airplane and soldier floats).

<h1><a name="Free">Freestyle/Front Crawl</a></h1>
Learning freestyle is much easier if you use a step by step approach based on a sequence of progressive swimming drills. These drills will let you learn the freestyle stroke in several steps:
<ol>
<li>
The first step is to learn static balance, which means you learn how to float effortlessly on your back, on your chest and on your sides.
</li>
<li>
The next step is to learn dynamic balance, which means you learn to maintain balance while rolling between different positions.
</li><li>
The third step is to practice balance while having the arms extended overhead, so as to get into the habit of swimming while being as tall as possible in the water.
</li><li>
The final step integrates the arm stroke movements and also lets you practice efficient swimming rhythms.
